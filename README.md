- Network compression plays an important role in accelerating deep neural networks, especially in the application of edge devices such as unmanned cars and drones. Recently, pruning-based methods have been improved significantly, but they still suffer from low efficiency because most of them only pay attention to feature similarities in the space domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain structured pruning method based on clustering (MDCP) which seamlessly integrates sufficient information extraction and knowledge distillation within a GAN-based framework, to address these aforementioned limitations.
